#Derivco Hackathon at NMMU 2016
##Man's best friend

I made this game for a hackathon. It's a simple puzzle-based game involving a man and his dog.
Unfortunately I couldn't really come up with the most complicated puzzles in the time we had. A lot
of concentration was spent on art, animation and functionality above all else.
